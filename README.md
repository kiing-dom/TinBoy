Tin Boy is a 2D platform game, 
that follows a recently programmed/created robot that must go through a 
series of trials that may include parkour and quick thinking, to prove that the Robot is capable of surviving in space.



Changes to the Final Game:
There are some inconsistencies with the GameDocument, that we couldn't iron out, like the score counter and collecting gears. These features did not make it into the final game
